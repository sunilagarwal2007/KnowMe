Graphology is a method of identifying, evaluating and understanding human personality traits through the strokes and patterns revealed by handwriting. Handwriting reveals the true personality including emotional outlay, fears, honesty, defenses and many others. Professional handwriting examiners called graphologists often identify thewriter with a piece of handwriting. Accuracy of handwriting analysis depends on how skilled the Analyst is. Although human intervention in handwriting analysis has been effective, it is costly and prone to error. Hence the proposed methodology focuses on developing a system that can predict the personality traits with the aid of machine learningwithout human intervention. To make this happen, we consider seven handwriting features: (i) size of letters, (ii) slant of the writing, (iii) baseline, (iv) pen pressure, (v) spacing between letters, (vi) spacing between words and (vii) top margin in a document to predict eight personality traits of a writer. After extracting all these features from the image containing the handwriting, eight support vector machines are trained which output each personality trait of the writer.
